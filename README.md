# Time-Series-Forecasting
Time Series Forecasting is making scientific projections based on data with historical time stamps in known as time series forecasting. It entails creating models through historical study, using them to draw conclusions and guide strategic decision-making in the future.

The fact that the future result is wholly unknown at the time of the task and can only be anticipated through thorough analysis and evidence-based priors is an essential distiction in forecasting.
